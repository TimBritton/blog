# Welcome to my Blog

Hello my name is Timothy Britton and this is my blog where I share my thoughts on different things programming related or not.

I am a full stack software engineer who focuses on Mobile and Backend development
two things that are very different in the challenges they provide but are interesting
in their own right.  

The articles I post here will likely be related to my tinkering with new frameworks and technologies.
